# Technical test - Backend/Cloud
In the Uponor Controls and Digital Services department we are thinking of creating the web application "Uponorflix", a streaming service for
series and movies with which we want to compete with other applications in the VOD market.
The first step to carry out the project, is to convince the marketing department that it is a great idea, and for that we need to make a
prototype with at least the following functionality:
Catalog. This page will show all the movies in the catalog with their information.
Add and edit movie. This page will show a form to edit or add a movie.
Delete movie
We need you to design and create the backend that this prototype will use. Taking into account that we want to build it under a serverless
architecture, we want you to deliver:
A Cloud Formation template for deploying the architecture of this solution, based on AWS, bearing in mind other services that might
support the serverless functions.
The code for one of the backend services listed above, built with Python.
It is recommended to add tests to avoid unexpected failures in the demo.
You are free to use any library that you think necessary and that will help you in the development.

Obviously for the moment we are not thinking about getting into the VOD market, but the key here is to approach the development as if you
were developing a real product and see if you could meet the quality standards we impose in our daily work.
If you have any questions or doubts while going through this exercise feel free to contact us for clarification if necessary.
